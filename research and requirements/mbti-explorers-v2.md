# Explorers (SP): ISTP • ISFP • ESTP • ESFP (V2)

These types share a preference for **Sensing (S)** (direct experience, practicality) and **Perceiving (P)** (flexibility, openness). In MBTI-like apps, they often resonate with language about experimentation, freedom, hands-on learning, and enjoying the present.

## Cross-cutting notes (use these in your UI)
- Career guidance should emphasize preferences and work satisfaction; MBTI is not designed for hiring/selection.
- Relationship guidance should avoid “best match” claims; focus on communication and respect.
