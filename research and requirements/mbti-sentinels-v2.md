# Sentinels (SJ): ISTJ • ISFJ • ESTJ • ESFJ (V2)

These types share a preference for **Sensing (S)** (practical reality, concrete detail) and **Judging (J)** (structure, planning, closure). In MBTI-like apps, they often resonate with language about reliability, duty, stability, responsibility, and building order.

## Cross-cutting notes (use these in your UI)
- MBTI preferences do not determine ability; all types can succeed in all careers.
- MBTI is not designed for hiring/selection.
- Relationship success is not about “matching types”; maturity and communication matter more.
