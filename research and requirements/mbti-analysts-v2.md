# Analysts (NT): INTJ • INTP • ENTJ • ENTP (V2)

These types share a preference for **Intuition (N)** (patterns, systems, possibilities) and **Thinking (T)** (logic, consistency, analysis). In MBTI-like apps, they often resonate with language about competence, autonomy, truth-seeking, strategy, and intellectual exploration.

## Cross-cutting notes (use these in your UI)
- Career guidance should emphasize satisfaction and preference-fit; MBTI is not designed for hiring/selection.
- Relationship guidance should avoid “best match” claims; focus on communication, pacing, and mutual respect.
