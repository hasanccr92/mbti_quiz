# MBTI Type Profiles Pack (V2) — Index

This pack contains long-form, implementation-ready profiles for all **16 MBTI types**, grouped by the common four-group organization:
- **Analysts (NT):** INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP
- **Diplomats (NF):** INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP
- **Sentinels (SJ):** ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ
- **Explorers (SP):** ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP

Each type includes sections you can directly reuse in your webapp:
- Short summary (top of results page)
- Strengths
- Watch-outs / blind spots
- Career & work style (with “environment fit” framing)
- Relationships (conflict + needs + what helps)
- Social interactions / friendship style
- Stress patterns + growth suggestions
- Implementation notes (how to phrase it in-app)

## Where the “official anchors” come from
The **core one-paragraph anchors** are based on the official 16-type descriptions published by the Myers & Briggs Foundation (excerpted from *Introduction to Myers‑Briggs® Type* by Isabel Briggs Myers).

## Ethical and scientific framing (recommended to show in-app)
- **Careers:** Type can support exploration, but MBTI is *not designed* for hiring or job selection, and preferences do not determine skills/competence.

- **Relationships:** There are *no best type combinations*; type awareness and maturity matter more than matching letters.

- **Reliability/validity:** Evaluations involve nuance (type vs trait measurement debate).

## Next step (if you want it even more extensive)
If you share:
- your target tone (clinical vs friendly vs playful)
- your target audience (teens vs adults vs workplace)
- whether you want cognitive functions included as an optional “advanced view”

…then the next iteration can expand each type with:
- “At work / at school / under stress / in love” scenario paragraphs
- “How to communicate with this type” scripts
- optional “adjacent types to explore if borderline”
