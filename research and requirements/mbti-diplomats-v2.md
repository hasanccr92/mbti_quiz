# Diplomats (NF): INFJ • INFP • ENFJ • ENFP (V2)

These types share a preference for **Intuition (N)** (meaning, patterns, possibilities) and **Feeling (F)** (values, impact on people). In MBTI-like apps, they often resonate with language about authenticity, growth, purpose, empathy, and relationships.

## Cross-cutting notes (use these in your UI)
- Avoid “best match” compatibility claims; type awareness and maturity matter more than shared letters.
- Career content should emphasize preference-fit and meaning; MBTI is not designed for hiring/selection.
